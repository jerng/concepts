# SUPO

An open-sourced fictional character.

## Initialisation

> I have come up with a design for our AI's avatar. It will be a dancing potato,
> in 3D. Very easy to animate. Zeitgeist morphology. Turns on and off with
> 'potato up / down'. We shall call it ... SUPO. - 2020-06-14

This is perfection.

Also notice that until there is some sort of DCMA takedown, I can talk about the
Supo Crew on social media. So one of the first orders of business about this
idea was to get it pushed to GitHub under an open-source license of some sort.
We'll find out later if I did this the right way, I suppose.

### Inspirations

Well, those of you who know about my business will know why and how I can make
use of this character. I do not believe there are limits to my speech about it.

A few years ago, one of my staff told me she was a potato. I understood it to
mean that she didn't want to take on much responsibility about whatever we were
discussing at the time. In this way, I came to learn that it was colloquially
acceptable to refer to people as potatos.

Eventually, my best friend started to refer to herself as a potato too, and then
so did I in my conversations with her. This has led to a great many puns about
potatos. So I suppose, SUPO is a sort of organic development from that.
