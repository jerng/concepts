Programming in one of many languages, for everyone.

Placeholder for a future foundation / non-profit / social enterprise / company that well, basically, helps with the knowledge management of popular computer programming languages, application stacks, and then some.

I really really hate unnecessary proliferation. And that's just where we are these days with programming languages. Wondering if I could get someone to fund a non-profit to consolidate 20-40 major languages + stacks (including say, 20 top databases) onto a single Linux distro for educational purposes.
