Using CakePHP 2.5.1

This is the app directory for a CakePHP app.

You will need to have CakePHP
[installed](http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/installation.html) correctly.

***Application***

This app matches human resources to projects. Projects may be of any domain,
for fun, for profit, intra-organisational, etc. The app's data structure
attempts to help people to define the requirements of a project, and the
supply of human resources available within a given universe. It assists in
reducing the cost of organising projects from scratch. Organise with care.
